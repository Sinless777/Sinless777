## 🚀 About Me

I’m a full-stack web developer, game designer, and founder of **SinLess Games LLC**.  
My work spans across software engineering, AI systems, Kubernetes infrastructure, game design, and large-scale automation. I’m deeply passionate about self-hosting, open-source, sci-fi, anime, RPGs, and world-building.

I build because I love learning, and I learn because I want to build things that *matter*.

## 🎮 Interests & Fun

I love blending technology with creativity — from AI and automation to world-building, modding, game systems, cyberpunk philosophy, and role-playing universes. When I’m not coding, I’m designing, writing, or exploring how we can push humanity forward through innovation and imagination.
