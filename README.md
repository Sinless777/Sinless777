# Hi there, I'm Timothy Pierce (Sinless777)

I'm a full-stack developer and game designer with a passion for technology, creativity, and a healthy dash of transhumanist humor. I studied game design at Full Sail University and continue learning game development there. When I'm not coding or designing, you'll find me exploring everything tech-related—self-hosting, open source, AI, sci-fi, anime, games, RPGs, and more.
